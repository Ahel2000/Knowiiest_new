Knowiiest is an initiative by a few students of IIEST Shibpur to help our freshers get accustomed to a new environment. It is a set of an app and website that includes description of hostels, tourist attractions around IIEST, common bus routes and above all books, class notes,etc that will be a great companion for an IIESTian.We have tried to address every question that we had during the first few days of our campus life.We will be happy if people get benefitted from the initiative.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
